            <li>
                <h3>Emotion Based Music Recommendations System</h3>
                <p>This project deals with detecting emotions of a person sitting in the car in the driverâ€™s seat and based on the emotion a song will be played accordingly. An add on to this project is drowsiness detection where an alert sound would be played. Uses concept of Machine Learning and Transfer Learning.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Automated Reflectors For Cars</h3>
                <p>This project uses STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller which belongs to the ARM Family. The purpose of the project is to automatically roll the reflector sheet covering the windows when the temperature inside the car increases.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Parking System Detection</h3>
                <p>This project deals with the detection of parking in particular slots by using counter to detect whether the slots are empty or occupied. This project uses techniques of computer vision and python programing.</p>
